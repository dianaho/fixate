          <h2>About Fixate</h2>
          <p>Welcome to our glorified timer app.</p>

        <h3>Read me first!</h3>
        <p>Fixate is a productivity app inspired by the Pomodoro technique for studying.
         It's basically a fun time management process which teaches you to work with 
         time rather than struggle against it.</p>

        <h3>How do I start?</h3>
        <p>Begin by deciding how long you want to study for.
         Think about a solid period of time you are able to study for uninterrupted.
         Then think about how long you would like your break times to be.
         (For maximum efficiency, we recommend 50/10 study/break sessions)
         Finally, decide how many sets of these you want to do! This can be anything as 
         low as 1 or as high as 10, depending on who much work you have to do.</p>

        <h3>What do I do during break times?</h3>
        <p>This entirely depends on you! You can save your breaks if you're focused and roll them over like cellphone minutes,
        or you can take a break directly after a session of studying. During this time,
        you can generate an activity to give you a cool idea to do something</p>

        <h3>Criticism</h3>
        <p>Your feedback is extremely important as it makes it easier for us to focus 
        on the right stuff. We encourage you to share your ideas and criticism because 
        they play a vital role in the process of building a useful app for you! </p>
